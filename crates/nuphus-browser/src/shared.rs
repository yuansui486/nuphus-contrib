//! Process-level shared BrowserClient (singleton).
//!
//! All browser consumers (browser_tools / web CDP rendering / cookies CDP data source)
//! reuse the same instance: the embedded browser uses a fixed profile_dir, and multiple
//! instances concurrently launching the same profile would conflict with each other;
//! a singleton + mutex eliminates the problem at the root.
//!
//! Runtime note: chromiumoxide's CDP handler is `tokio::spawn`ed onto the ambient runtime at
//! launch, and its lifetime must match BrowserClient. Any browser operation initiated from a
//! synchronous context runs on [`runtime()`], the process-level resident runtime; temporary
//! runtimes are forbidden (dropping one kills the handler, leaving a zombie browser connection).
